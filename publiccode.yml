      **Tools for Publishing Open Source Software**

      Federal agencies are required to disclose the source code of software they
      develop or have developed to fulfill their duties. They must allow anyone
      to use, further develop, and distribute the software without charging
      licensing fees. This requirement is outlined in Article 9 of the Federal
      Act on the Use of Electronic Means for Fulfilling Administrative Tasks
      (EMOTA). Responsibility for implementation lies with the individual
      agencies. The Federal Chancellery provides suitable tools to assist
      federal agencies in meeting this requirement.


      **What is it about?**

      When publishing open-source software, questions regarding legal matters,
      licenses, security, organization, and costs need to be addressed.
      Depending on the specific use case, there are variations and limitations
      to consider. The level of knowledge required to implement the legal
      requirement varies within the federal administration based on experience.
      For this reason, the Federal Chancellery has created tools and checklists
      to provide support and guidance for decision-making.
