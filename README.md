This GitHub repository is used to work on the next version of the guidelines. We aim to actively **involve the community** in this process.

- **Small changes** are made directly on GitHub.  
- **Major or substantial changes** developed on GitHub lead to a new main version. This version undergoes the **standard review process** of the Federal Chancellery. After successful approval, the new version is published and translated.
